This so openly demeaned them  \nthat many black women, long after they had left the South,  \nrefused to answer if called by their first name. A mother  \nand father in 1970s Texas named their newborn “Miss” so  \nthat white people would have no choice but to address their  \ndaughter by that title. Black women were meant for the field  \nor the Kitchen, or for use as they saw fit. They were, by  \ndefinition, not ladies. The very idea of a black woman as  \nfirst lady of the land, well, that would have been unthinkable.\n\n_Disponível em: www.nytimes.com Acesso em 28 dex. 2018 (adaptado)_",
